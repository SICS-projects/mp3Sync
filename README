What is this project about:

The mp3Sync project is a software system that includes:

Main featues
============

* a mobile mp3 player for (android and apple) devices that syncronizes the mp3 files to a server and from a server. It does that in the way as you wish to. 
  You can change settings if you wish to or/and use the smart feature of the player. 
  The smart feature learns from your choises in the past and use that in a very special way.

* a server part (written in PHP) that organizes all your mp3 files. 
  The organizer allows you for example: To specify what file has to be on what device, when sould the mp3 files be syncronized(only on Wifi/WLAN connection, only if there is traffic left on G3)

* a desktop part (written in java) that has the same funtions as the mobile program parts. 


This is what the system should work like and there are more features planed for the feature. 
But at the moment it is important to create, test and release the main featues. 



What is the technical background behind the project
===================================================

The syncronization is desiged as folowing:

There is one server written in php. On this server is a mysql database working. 
The server knows what mp3 file is on what device(if you have more than one device. for example: android mobile phone, and personal computer)

So if there is syncronization needed the server starts that.
